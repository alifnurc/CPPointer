# Introduction to NULL Pointer

NULL pointer is a pointer that points to nothing, and not just an invalid address.

```cpp
int *ptr1 = 0;
```

and

```cpp
int *ptr2 = nullptr;
```

or

```cpp
int *ptr2 = nullptr;
```

are the same.

## Conclusion

`nullptr` is more savety than `NULL` in modern C++.
